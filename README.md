My new data file’s name is Senior Centers & Nursing Homes in Howard County. Howard County. “Of the nearly 5.7 million people in Maryland in 2010, 18.6% (1,058,253) were over the age of 60. The percentage is expected to increase to 25.8% of Marayland’s projected population of 6.7 million by the year 2030.” U.S Census. 2015. Maryland Department of Aging, Retrieved from http://www.aging.maryland.gov/Statistics.html

This file is a combination of the names of the senior centers, the locations including addresses, and their identification numbers and the “Nursing Homes” data set which includes names of the nursing homes, addresses, and phone numbers. 

Is it possible to identify or locate the names of the Senior Centers and Nursing Homes in one City of Howard County by merging (combining) the “Nursing Homes” data set into the “Senior Centers” data set?
